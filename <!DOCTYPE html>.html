        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Granger, and I am interested in 3D printing things with my printer. I started in April 2024, and recently I have been printing many things, like toys, convenience items, and even home decoratives.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="projects" class="content-wrapper">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the random things I've printed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Failed Honda Civic Print:</strong>
                <p>My first ever project was a failed print of a Honda Civic that I created myself. It was red, and the reason for it to be a failed print was because the filament feeder was jammed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Successful Pyramid Print:</strong>
                <p>My first ever print that was fully successful was a simple miniature pyramid, that had a tiny square on the top. It was also red, and the reason it worked was because after a few days of inspection of the printer, I managed to find the main cause for the 3D printer to be jammed. The pyramid took 45 minutes to print, and it had a really strong adhesion, so it took some time to remove it from the print bed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hexagon Shelf:</strong>
                <p>My other project that I want to share was a home decorative. I called it the hexagon shelf, as it is just many hexagons of different colors nailed together on the wall. The hexagon shelf is able to fit many small things inside, depending on the weight and shape.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="tips" class="tips content-wrapper">
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>Here are some tips for successful 3D printing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calibrate Your Printer Regularly:</strong> Ensure that your 3D printer is properly calibrated to avoid issues with print quality and adhesion.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Quality Filament:</strong> High-quality filament can significantly impact the quality of your prints. Always choose filament from reputable suppliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain a Clean Print Bed:</strong> A clean and level print bed is crucial for proper adhesion and successful prints.</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment with Settings:</strong> Donâ€™t be afraid to tweak print settings such as temperature, speed, and layer height to achieve the best results for different types of prints.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Updated:</strong> Keep up with the latest advancements in 3D printing technology and techniques to continually improve your skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Warping Issues:</strong> Sometimes, a 3D print can have issues with the bottom. If the bottom of your 3D print is misshaped, it is most likely because your print warped. This happens when the temperature of the filament coming out is cooling too quickly, causing it to change shape from what it is supposed to look like. To prevent this from happening, you can apply some school glue to the print bed, or simply level your print bed. Another way is to just try to control the temperature around the 3D printer.</li>
            <li><strong>Filament Feeding Issues:</strong> When your 3D printer is moving on track, but no filament is coming out, it is most likely because the gear to feed in your filament is jammed. Prevent this from happening by keeping dust and debris away from the spot.</li>
        </ul>
